<h1>We Have a New Website!</h1>
<p>Welcome friends and family and strangers alike to our new website! Real Canadian Recreation will be opening in 2020 and this little piece of electronic land is where we will be all of our updates as we progress and prepare for opening! We are growing evermore excited to open our doors next year! Here is a small glimpse as to what’s in store without giving too much away:</p>

<ul>
    <li>On site in Pictou we will have 500 acres of land all carved into beautiful trails and camping sites, event grounds and more!</li>
    <li>There will be regularly occurring recreational events for a variety of fun. This includes four wheeler games, target practice, and other things we cannot yet reveal!</li>
    <li>We have four wheelers and bikes available to rent so you can journey without your own equipment.</li>
    <li>And even more that we will announce at a later date!</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we’ve explained those few things, we will wait until next time to reveal more! Sorry to keep you waiting! Bye!!</p>
